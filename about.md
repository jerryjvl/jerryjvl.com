**Jerry** has been many things including Manager, Team Lead, and Delivery Lead. But right now he is a senior developer at [Heap](https://heap.io) working remotely from Sydney, Australia.

When not working he has a slight obsession with D&D streams and D&D games. My current character is a cat-person named Chatuluka.
